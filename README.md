# Database Engine
# Overview
This project is a simulation of a simple database engine that uses B+ trees for indexing. The database engine supports fundamental operations including creating tables, creating indices, inserting records, deleting records, and selecting records from tables. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the core functionalities of a database management system (DBMS) and how indexing with B+ trees can optimize data retrieval.

# Features
Create Tables: Define new tables with specified schema.
Create Indices: Create B+ tree indices on specified columns to enhance query performance.
Insert Records: Add new records to the tables.
Delete Records: Remove records from the tables based on specified conditions.
Select Records: Retrieve records from the tables using various query conditions.
